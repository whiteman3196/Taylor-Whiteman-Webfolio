<h2>SM323 - Cross Functional Business Plan</h2>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px">SM323 is one of the key elements differentiating the Questrom School of Business Undergraduate curriculum from other programs. SM323 consists of four courses - Marketing (MK323), Operations (OM323), Finance (FE323), and Business Analytics (QM323). The four courses are integrated into this unique one-semester required sequence through a semester-long project. SM323 provided me with a cross-functional experience that enabled me to significantly leverage my learning investment in all four courses. The SM323 New Product project is the cornerstone of SM323. The project was designed so that upon completion of the program, I then knew how to assess customers and markets and how to work in teams to design a new product that meets customer needs, how to develop operations processes, as well as how to assess the risks involved in implementing and financing the resulting business.

	For the SM323 New Product project I worked in a team of 10, to create a product we called the Zzz Mobile. Taking the traditional baby mobile and adding 21st century accutrements to it, we were able to futher connect parents and newborns. By using a contemporary design and recycled materials, we were able to create a baby mobile that works in any nursery setting. Also with the addition of Bluetooth connectivity, we gave parents the ability to custom record messages for their newborn children to play over the baby mobile speaker. 
	<br><br>
	While the project consists of four main courses, my role on the team specifically focused on the Marketing and Finance portions of the product development. Working with the Finance Team, we were able to forcast our expected 5-Year profitability if we were to bring this product to market. We used the market research that we conducted to estimate demand and worked with those in operations to understand the projected costs for the Zzz Mobile. We were able to factor in everything from the plastic pellets to make the arm to the billboard outside Savannah, Georgia. No line item went unaccounted for and everything was taken into consideration. 
	<br><br>
	And with the Marketing team, we were tasked with coming up with creative and unexpected ways to market our product to new families. When brainstroming ideas for how to market our product to parents of newborns, we decided to get our product in their minds as soon as we possibly could. So along with tradtional POP displays, decorative packaging and traditional advertising channels, we wanted to put our Zzz Mobile on the first bed the baby will sleep in. So we decided to donate our Zzz Mobiles to Hospitals around the country to put on the crib the baby sleeps in while staying at the hospital. Parents would be able to custom record their voice into the mobile and play the tune whenever they please, so that even though the baby might be in another room, the bond between the child and the parent can be cultivated from the earliest possible moment.
