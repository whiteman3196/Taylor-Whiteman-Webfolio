<h2>MK447 - Market Research Analysis</h2>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px">
	MK447 is an introductory Market Research class with a heavy enphasis on IBM's SPSS software. For this course we were instructed to work alongside a local business in the Greater Boston Area to help them with any issues their business might be facing in terms of their marketing strategy. My team and I partnered with local gym "GymIt", which is located directly across the street from Boston University's own gym factility. We were tasked with helping GymIt understand how they could possibly drive more student traffic into their doors and away from BU's offering. 
	<br><br>
	After setting our targets and understanding who our survey group should be, we used survey tool Qualtrics to distribute surveys to the Boston University Undergraduate community. After recieving 175 individual responses, or about 1% of the student population, we ran various Quantitative measues to understand why students were not interested in what GymIt was offering. To little suprise to our team, money was the key motivator. While GymIt had smaller crowds and just as wide a variety of equipment as BU's own gym, students were not willing to pay for GymIt. Since BU incorporates their gym fees into Undergraduate tuition, students had nothing extra to pay out of pocket.
	<br><br>
	When presenting these findings to GymIt, we had three main ideas for them to promote their business to Boston University students. We suggested GymIt heavily advertise their more expanded hours and smaller crowds as compared to BU's gym. We also wanted GymIt to offer some type of promotion to recent graduates and current students of the University, in an attempt to raise the willingness-to-pay for these potential clients. And lastly we wanted GymIt to hire some type of brand ambassador for Boston University to promote GymIt to the students.
