We required our volunteers to submit forms to keep track of the amount of food we salavaged and to keep tabs on the health of our vehicles. But due to the complexity of the URL the volunteers needed to type in to access the form, many were avoiding filling out logs altogether.<br><br>So as a way to mitigate this problem we tested two solutions; one of which is an iOS app that I developed for the volunteers.This app allowed our volunteers to view all of the logs they needed to access in a much easier format. We also decided the app could be a way to access directions to the various waypoints on their trip. We were also considerating incorporating a way to log damage to the vans, if that issue arose.<br><br>My team and I had big dreams about what this app could do for our volunteers. While this app never left our closed beta, feel free to view the repository at the link below or run a simulation of SFR Movile v0.9 at the link to the right.
