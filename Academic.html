    <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px">SM323 is one of the key elements differentiating the Questrom School of Business Undergraduate curriculum from other programs. SM323 consists of four courses - Marketing (MK323), Operations (OM323), Finance (FE323), and Business Analytics (QM323). The four courses are integrated into this unique one-semester required sequence through a semester-long project. SM323 provided me with a cross-functional experience that enabled me to significantly leverage my learning investment in all four courses. The SM323 New Product project is the cornerstone of SM323. The project was designed so that upon completion of the program, I then knew how to assess customers and markets and how to work in teams to design a new product that meets customer needs, how to develop operations processes, as well as how to assess the risks involved in implementing and financing the resulting business.

<p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px">
	For the SM323 New Product project I worked in a team of 10, to create a product we called the Zzz Mobile. Taking the traditional baby mobile and adding 21st century accutrements to it, we were able to futher connect parents and newborns. By using a contemporary design and recycled materials, we were able to create a baby mobile that works in any nursery setting. Also with the addition of Bluetooth connectivity, we gave parents the ability to custom record messages for their newborn children to play over the baby mobile speaker. 
	<br><br>
	While the project consists of four main courses, my role on the team specifically focused on the Marketing and Finance portions of the product development. Working with the Finance Team, we were able to forcast our expected 5-Year profitability if we were to bring this product to market. We used the market research that we conducted to estimate demand and worked with those in operations to understand the projected costs for the Zzz Mobile. We were able to factor in everything from the plastic pellets to make the arm to the billboard outside Savannah, Georgia. No line item went unaccounted for and everything was taken into consideration. 
	<br><br>
	And with the Marketing team, we were tasked with coming up with creative and unexpected ways to market our product to new families. When brainstroming ideas for how to market our product to parents of newborns, we decided to get our product in their minds as soon as we possibly could. So along with tradtional POP displays, decorative packaging and traditional advertising channels, we wanted to put our Zzz Mobile on the first bed the baby will sleep in. So we decided to donate our Zzz Mobiles to Hospitals around the country to put on the crib the baby sleeps in while staying at the hospital. Parents would be able to custom record their voice into the mobile and play the tune whenever they please, so that even though the baby might be in another room, the bond between the child and the parent can be cultivated from the earliest possible moment.

For this course we were instructed to work alongside a local business in the Greater Boston Area to help them with any issues their business might be facing in terms of their marketing strategy. My team and I partnered with local gym "GymIt", which is located directly across the street from Boston University's own gym factility. We were tasked with helping GymIt understand how they could possibly drive more student traffic into their doors and away from BU's offering. 
	<br><br>
	After setting our targets and understanding who our survey group should be, we used survey tool Qualtrics to distribute surveys to the Boston University Undergraduate community. After recieving 175 individual responses, or about 1% of the student population, we ran various Quantitative measues to understand why students were not interested in what GymIt was offering. To little suprise to our team, money was the key motivator. While GymIt had smaller crowds and just as wide a variety of equipment as BU's own gym, students were not willing to pay for GymIt. Since BU incorporates their gym fees into Undergraduate tuition, students had nothing extra to pay out of pocket.
	<br><br>
	When presenting these findings to GymIt, we had three main ideas for them to promote their business to Boston University students. We suggested GymIt heavily advertise their more expanded hours and smaller crowds as compared to BU's gym. We also wanted GymIt to offer some type of promotion to recent graduates and current students of the University, in an attempt to raise the willingness-to-pay for these potential clients. And lastly we wanted GymIt to hire some type of brand ambassador for Boston University to promote GymIt to the students.

    <p style="text-align: center; word-spacing: 2px; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'; font-size: 18px">MK475 is a course that focuses on the special challenges that arise when working as a marketer for a luxury brand. Since luxury exists in a sphere beyond traditonal consumption, there are several "Anti-Laws" of Marketing that apply to these brands. And while some of these Anti-Laws are true, many of which are struggling to keep up with the changes in this industry brought on by E-Commerce and Portable Computing. 
	<br><br>
	For this course my team and I were tasked with understanding the past, present, and future for the Luxury Automobile market. We analyzed the various changes the industry has gone through in the past years and forcasted projections for where we see the industry going. After creating detailed analyses on each individual brand in the market and the greatest macro-economic trends the industry is facing we forecasted on which brands will thrive in the near-future and which will being to falter.
